# pyclients
Use clients through ssh.

### When, Why?
If your databases/services are sitting behind a jump host (kafka cluster, mongodb, redis, etc.) and 
you have already exhaustively tried tunneling to no avail, then this library might help. It provides high-level APIs 
to query different remote clients over ssh. 

**NOTE**: *This is a work in progress. Library is currently just a prototype as it lacks multiple features, 
testing, and automation. As of now only the kafka API has been fleshed out.*
